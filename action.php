You are their guardian, their protector, YOU are responsible for what happens to your child so use what you now know about child vehicle safety and make a difference.</p>

        <p>If you witness something that doesn’t follow child vehicle safety protocol do something. For example, if you witness someone lock their infant in the car while they go run errands notify the proper authorities immediately and proceed to break the window opposite of the infant to get it out. Be sure to wait for the authorities to arrive while you hold the infant. Always make sure to lock your car and keep your keys out of reach of children.</p>
