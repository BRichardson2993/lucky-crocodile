							<h2 id="front_back">Front&dash;overs/Back&dash;overs</h2>
							<img src="images/backoverDanger.png" alt="Backover interior" class="resize float_right">
							<h3>How It Happens:</h3>
							<p>Children love to play and hide around all kinds of different obstacles and to them a vehicle is no more unsafe than a tree in the front yard.</p>
							<p>A front&dash;over or back&dash;over occurs when a driver doesn&rsquo;t see a child in front or behind and sets the vehicle in motion resulting in injury or death.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="facts">
							<h3>Facts:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Of all non&dash;traffic fatalities involving children under 15 years old from 2006 to 2010</li>
								<li>30&#37; of those were from front&dash;overs while 34&#37; were from back&dash;overs.</li>
								<li>Front&dash;overs and back&dash;overs can happen in any vehicle because all vehicles have a blindzone, an area around a vehicle that can&rsquo;t be seen from the driver&rsquo;s seat.</li>
								<li>The predominant age of back&dash;over victims is one year old.</li>
								<li>Over 60&#37; of incidents involved larger size vehicle such as a truck, van, or SUV.</li>
								<li>Sadly in a little over 70&#37; of these incidents, a close relative or parent are usually the ones behind the wheel.</li>

						</div>
						<div class="facts_right">
							<h3>Facts:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>A stranger doesn&rsquo;t need to forcefully take the child. Persuading them to exit the vehicle with temptations is just as much a threat as breaking a window and taking the child.</li>
								<li>It can only take a few seconds for your child to be taken.</li>
								<li>Additionally, a child can be unintentionally abducted should a stranger attempt to steal your vehicle.</li>
							</ul>

						<div class="how">
							<h2 id="in_motion">Vehicle Accidentally Set in Motion</h2>
							<img src="images/motionDanger.png" alt="controls image" class="resize float_right">
							<h3>How it Happens:</h3>

						<div class="facts">
							<h3>Facts:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Window controls are easy to operate.</li>

							<img src="images/windowDanger.png" alt="window image" class="resize float_left">
							<h3>How it Happens:</h3>
							<p>Curious and playful children want to touch everything and operate moving pieces. Left unattended, they can activate many of the vehicle&rsquo;s automatic features. Innocent playtime can quickly become harmful or even deadly.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="facts_right">

								<li>Thousands of children have been harmed or killed by power windows.</li>
