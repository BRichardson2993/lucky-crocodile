							<h2 id="front_back">Front&dash;overs/Back&dash;overs</h2>
							<img src="images/backoverDanger.png" alt="Backover interior" class="resize float_right">
							<h3>How It Happens:</h3>
							<p>Children love to play and hide around all kinds of different obstacles and to them a vehicle is no more unsafe than a tree in the front yard.</p>
							<p>A front&dash;over or back&dash;over occurs when a driver doesn't see a child in front or behind and sets the vehicle in motion resulting in injury or death.</p>

							<h3>Facts:</h3>
							<p>Of all non-traffic fatapties involving children under 15 years old from 2006 to 2010 30% of those were from front-overs while 34% were from back-overs.</p>
							<p>Front-overs and back-overs can happen in any vehicle because all vehicles have a bpndzone, an area around a vehicle that can&rsquo;t be seen from the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>
							<p>The predominant age of back-over victims is one year old.</p>
							<p>Over 60% of back up incidents involved larger size vehicle such as a truck, van, or SUV.</p>
							<p>Sadly in a pttle over 70% of these incidents, a close relative or parent are usually the ones behind the wheel.</p>

							<h2 id="abduction">Abduction</h2>
							<img src="images/abductionDanger.png" alt="abduction danger" class="resize float_left">
							<h3>How it Happens:</h3>
							<p>Children left alone in a vehicle are vulnerable to being taken.</p>
							<p>Unattended children have access to door locks. Easily influenced, a stranger can coerce them into unlocking the vehicle.</p>

							<h3>Facts:</h3>
							<p>A stranger doesn&rsquo;t need to forcefully take the child. Persuading them to exit the vehicle with temptations is just as much a threat as breaking a window and taking the child.</p>
							<p>It can only take a few seconds for your child to be taken.</p>
							<p>Additionally, a child can be unintentionally abducted should a stranger attempt to steal your vehicle.</p>

							<h2 id="in_motion">Vehicle Accidentally Set in Motion</h2>
							<img src="images/motionDanger.png" alt="controls image" class="resize float_right">
							<h3>How it Happens:</h3>
							<p>Unattended children in a vehicle can free themselves from car seats, gaining access to controls. Re&dash;enacting a movie racecar or spaceship scene can put them at risk of endangering their or another's life.</p>

							<h3>Facts:</h3>
							<p>Window controls are easy to operate.</p>
							<p>Gear&amp;shifts are usually easily moved levers.</p>
							<p>A child doesn&rsquo;t have to be targeting a control to activate it. They may simply grab it or use it for support while moving about the vehicle.</p>
							<p>Of all non-traffic fatalities involving children between 2006 and 2010 vehicle in motion made up 5% of all fatalities.</p>

							<img src="images/windowDanger.png" alt="window image" class="resize float_left">
							<h3>How it Happens:</h3>
							<p>Curious and playful children want to touch everything and operate moving pieces. Left unattended, they can activate many of the vehicle&rsquo;s automatic features. Innocent playtime can quickly become harmful or even deadly.</p>

							<h3>Facts:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Power windows can easily break small bones and cause strangulation.</li>
								<li>Thousands of children have been harmed or killed by power windows.</li>
								<li>The amount of upward force a power window exerts up is between 30 and 80 pounds.</li>
