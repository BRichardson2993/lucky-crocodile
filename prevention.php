        <p>So now that you know the dangers, what can you do to prevent tragedy?</p>

        <section>
        <h2>Inside the Vehicle</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Clean your car regularly – especially of small objects such as trinkets, toys, or stray food items that may have fallen into hidden spaces; be sure to look under seats and in storage areas</li>
            <li>Choose foods that are easily chewed and swallowed to prevent choking, or cut foods into small pieces and remove things such as seeds and pits, and never leave a child unattended while eating</li>
            <li>Place the child’s car seat so it is not directly behind the driver’s seat</li>
            <li>Place a visual cue in the front seat, such as a diaper bag or stuffed animal, to remind yourself that the child is in the back seat</li>
        </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Outside the Vehicle</h2>
            <img src="images/suv_image.png" alt="Car Image" class="resize">
            <ul>
                <li>Always bring your child with you when you exit the vehicle – no amount of time is safe to leave your child unattended in the vehicle, even for “just a minute”, and it is illegal to do so in some states</li>
                <li>Be sure that you lock the vehicle’s doors and trunk after exiting with your child – even when parked and at home, a vehicle can endanger a child, as they can become trapped within it if left open</li>
                <li>Instruct children that the vehicle is not a safe place to play</li>
            </ul>

       <section>
           <h2>In General</h2>

           <ul>
               <li>Familiarize yourself with life-saving techniques such as the Heimlich Maneuver, child cardiopulminary resuscitation (CPR), and other first-aid measures, and call 911 for emergencies</li>
               <li>Be sure your child's caretaker(s) are aware of the dangers and solutions, and always have a plan of action in case of emergency</li>
               <li>Be aware of your child's behavior and condition: if they are acting strange or confused, or if they are exhibiting nausea, dizziness, sudden cessation of sweating, or quick/slow pulse, they may be suffering heat stroke</li>
           </ul>
